# Lethal Company mod manifest creator

Just a simple script to export a list of mods to a valid manifest file so I can upload my mods in a modpack to https://thunderstore.io/. I threw this together in a jiffy so probably a bunch of bugs :) 

You have to option to either create a new manifest file or update an existing one. The list has to be in the same format as the list exported by r2modman.
## TODO:
- [*] Add functionality to export a text file of mods to a manifest file
- [] Add manifest validation with thunderstores API
- [] Add readme validation with thunderstores API
- [] Add uploading of manifest and other files directly to thunderstore
